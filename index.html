              <span class="bld">James Harris</span>, 54, poses for a photo
              Tuesday, Oct. 3, 2017, in Los Angeles. Harris has had AIDS for 30
              years, he said. When medication stopped working, he got depressed
              and was evicted. Now he feels like an outcast, vulnerable and
              struggling to survive. Heâ€™s hoping that as a veteran he can get
              permanent housing, though he missed an earlier opportunity because
              a stint in a shelter disqualified him from being considered
              chronically homeless. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong).
