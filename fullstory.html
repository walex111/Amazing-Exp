              <span class="highlight">LOS ANGELES (AP)</span> — It’s easy to
              walk past the homeless, to disregard the guy lying on the street
              or ignore the woman standing at an intersection holding a
              handwritten sign with a plea for help. It’s harder to look away
              when you’ve seen their eyes. Look past lines drawn by hard living
              or the still-soft skin of someone young but struggling to break
              the cycle of dependency or abuse. Their eyes hint at lost promise
              or offer a glimmer of hope. Some are haunting, some placid. Others
              troubled or masking troubles. Some are warm and tender; others
              tough and anxious. You wonder: Why did they end up here? How do
              they get by on so little? What do they need to get back on their
              feet? The questions don’t always have easy answers. Solutions are
              not always available. The extent of someone’s past troubles can be
              impossible to know. As part of its project looking at the homeless
              crisis on the West Coast, AP photographer Jae Hong went to
              Seattle, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles to shoot
              intimate portraits of the people with no permanent homes. He used
              a special lens to focus on their eyes. Here are the stories those
              people told. On June 21st, 2006, I went to my Aunt's to see if she
              knew either my Mom's or my Dad's number and it so happened she
              did. I called and they both sent me a total of about $180 for my
              birthday. Stupid me, I spent a lot of it on booze, but I bought
              food and clothes with the rest of the money.
